## Greetings 🧙
I'm a software developer student from Sweden with a simple goal: leave the world in a better place than I found it. I do this by helping out where I can and try to develop products and services that I think the everyday person could benefit from.

### Ongoing projects:

[**ReciPies**](https://github.com/BullenMoore/ReciPies)  
A self-hosted recipe manager service that can either be run as a single-user application, or as a webpage making it possible to share and edit recipes as a collective.  

[**Home Assistant Blueprint Library (HABL)**](https://github.com/BullenMoore/Home-Assistant-Blueprint-Library)  
A library of Home Assistant blueprints for popular Zigbee and Matter devices
